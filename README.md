## FAQ 
**Q: How is Artificial Intelligence defined in the framework?**
**A:** The framework aims to assess companies developing and deploying across the tool chain including companies developing Foundation Models, as well as those leveraging model APIs. The framework should also include AI solutions and services including SaaS and AI-embedded functions, AI data pipeline companies, AI software modules, AI/ML lifecycle management platforms and tools, and AI-related infrastructure companies (often referred to as MLOps). 

**Q: Why a Responsible AI and Safety Framework being created by a venture capital fund?**
**A** Venture capital has become an essential driver of economic value. In 2020, venture capital-backed companies accounted for 41% of total US market capitalization and 62% of US public companiesâ€™ R&D spending. Among the public companies founded within the last fifty years, venture funded companies account for half in number, three quarters by value, and more than 92% of R&D spending and patent value. The fact that only approximately 0.5% of companies receive venture financing in the US demonstrates the disproportionate role that venture capital plays in the economy.

In 2022, there were 32 significant industry-produced machine learning models compared to just 3 produced by academia. Many of these companies received their first capital from venture investors. Building state-of-the-art AI systems increasingly requires large amounts of data, compute, and thus money. In addition to addressing nonprofit and academic access to these resources, it is important that investors have the appropriate tools and information to assess the technologies that gain access to funding.
